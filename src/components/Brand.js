                <h3>Who are we and what is our goal?</h3>

                <p>Our main goal is of course to give our customers great quality products with a wide range of designs to choose from and
                    and to have a calm and pleasant time browzing through our site. We do this by providing a minimalistic UI that is easy to navigate.
                    We are using grey scale, and only two shades of orange for CTAs. This use of colors should guide the costumer on what action to do next
                    without thinking about it, which creates a friendly UX.
                </p>
                <p>We want the costumer to feel that they can create a personal style for their space and feel confident about our products.</p>

                <h3>Target audience</h3>

                <p>Our target audience is creative and have an eye for quality designs.</p>
                <p>They are climate concious and want their home to reflect their personality,
                    and appreciate organic forms and textures.
                </p>

                <h3>Our tone and voice</h3>

                <p>ItÂ´s important for us that our customers can feel us being trustworthy, so how do we do that? 
                    Well first of all we can try to see from our customers perspective, what do they expect from us?
                    We think that the best way to go about it is to be clear and forthcomming in our communication,
                    meaning that we pay attention to details and have an inpiring and positive tone in our headers and body text.
                    Use adjectives that stimulate entusiasm.
